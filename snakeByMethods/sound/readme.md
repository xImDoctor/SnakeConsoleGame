# About music and sounds

This project uses music and sounds from free sources only for demonstrative purposes. <br>
Because the ```PlaySound()``` from ```Windows API``` only works with audio files of the format ```.wav```, and these files are quite large, and due to limitations, the music file (```toreador.wav```, ~42 MB) cannot be uploaded directly to the github.<br>
<br>
If you want to see (or rather hear) it when building the project, you can download it using <a href="https://disk.yandex.ru/d/xBs68gWFqDXaFw">this link to my Yandex.Disk</a> and add it to this folder.
